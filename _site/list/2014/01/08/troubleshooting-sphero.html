<h4>My Sphero is trying to kill me, what should I do?</h4>

<ol>
<li>Start Running</li>
<li>Hope that Sphero is low on power</li>
<li>Keep Running</li>
<li>If possible, push someone into Sphero&#39;s path.</li>
<li>If Sphero gets close, begin to hoping up and down. Doing so will not save you, but may provide those around you with some amusement.</li>
<li>Die as Sphero burrows a hole in your chest.</li>
</ol>
