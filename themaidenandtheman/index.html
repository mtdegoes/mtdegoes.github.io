                        <p>Hello my love. Sit back while I tell you a story...</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once upon a time, there was fair Scottish lass, named Courtney.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She dressed in plain clothes and lived in a simple kingdom, in a humble cottage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Her beauity was known throughout the small town of Brockton and it's surrounding country-side.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There was scarecely a man who didn't wish to posess her, body and soul.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>One day she had taken to the highlands, enjoying a walk in the crisp morning air, when she spotted a man on the horizon.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She paused, for it was not always safe to wonder the highlands, not knowing the sort of men she would encounter.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then, at once, the man on the horizon began to run, and his course was clearly in her direction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A few more seconds passed while she sought to determine his features.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As he closed, his features grew clear and she could tell he was tall, powerfully built and with a calm way about him, though underlined by something slightly savage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He closed quickly and her several courses of action flitted through her mind.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She decided that a swift return to her cottage was best, and began sprinting down the lane.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Despite her speed, he gained on her but she had just enough time to reach the cottage and slam the door when, the persuer hit the door with a hard thud.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Out of breath, she leant against the door, waiting with slight apprehension.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A few seconds passed, before the door thudded strongly, and a deep hoarse voice sounded from the other side.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"Fair lass, let me in", the voice begged. "For I have traveled far, and you are fairest thing I've seen in all my life."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"But sir, I do not know you, and your persuit gave me quite the start". She responsed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To which he replied, "I mean you no harm, fair miss. I thought perhaps you were a mirage, or phantom which would disappear."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"It is for this reason, I sought you quickly", the man finished.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After pondering for a few moments, the fair maiden replied. "I am sorry sir, but I cannot permit you enterace. For I know nothing of you, or your intentions."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A long sigh, was heard from the outside of the door, and then a heavy weight settled against the it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A long moment passed, before he responded. "I am british, come from far south of here, to seek the fairest maiden in the land, and possess her."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The words of the man speed the maidens heart and kindled an anticipation deep within.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"If you would possess me, then be patient sir, and court me as a proper gentleman would." The woman answered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Another long sigh sounded from outside the door before a reply came, that had with it good humor mixed with just a hint of frustration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"I give you till midnight tonight."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The weight pressed against the door lifted, and she could hear the mans foot steps moving off.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The beating of her heart slowed and after a few seconds she dared to peak through a small crack in the wooden door.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The man had moved away from the house, and lifting a heavy pack from his back, set it by the stone hedge, which skirted the house.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He then looked back to the house, with light blue eye's that seemed to peirce the door. Almost as though he knew she was watching.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After a few minutes, of resting himself, the man rose from the ground rummaged in his pack. After finding what he was looking for, he approached the house, and hung something just out of sight on the door outside bolt.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He then surveyed the small cottage and it's surroundings, before setting to work.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As with any highlands homestead, there were small choirs that needed to be accomplished. Wood chopped, troughs filled with water, and animals fed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He proceeded about each task accomplishing one after the next, until evening fell and little light remained.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then tired and weary from the days exhertions, he rested by the fire and fried a fish from the nearby creek.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The meal seemed to refresh him, and after a long stretch and gaze back to the cottage, where the maiden still kept watch, he wondered down to the creek. Just out of her view.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The maiden Courtney, deciding it was safe enough, opened the door and retrieved the object he had hung.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now by candle light, she could just make out a silver chain and ornament, shaped like a Claddagh ring. Her hands moved over the familiar shape, and her heart quickened.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hearing a loud splash outside, she peared through the openeing, but was unable to see the man, as the embankment dipped below her sight.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Climbing up to the small atic, she found a suitable crack, and peered out down to the river bank, which was illuminated by the fire, the englishman had lit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There in the soft glow of the fire and moon light, the man stood naked, waist deep in water. His hard muscled body glistening.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As he cupped and then poured water over his head, small rivuletts ran down his naked skin, curving around and almost tracing his full chest and hardened abs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>His hands passed over his skin, removing traces of dirt that remained before turning around, and striding out of the water.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She could see his full naked body, only his manhood was obscured by both moon and firelight.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As she watched, she could feel her own bodies desires begin to awaken and become sensitive. Then her heart jumed a beat, as she realized he was moving toward the cottage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She turned and began rushing down from the attic, in an effort to reach the front door.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>But as she reached the bottom run of the ladder, her foot missed it's purchase, causing her to trip and fall to the floor.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The maiden began to raise herself off the ground, but stopped, as the door to the small cottage burst open revealing the britshman's naked form lit from the firelight outside.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She froze, as he strode forward and with powerful arms lifted her from the floor.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then with one arm wrapped around her waist and one hand to her head, he brought her close for a passionate kiss.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The furvor of his kiss continued, as his tongue explored her mouth and her's his.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She could feel her body awaken, as the embrace continued, her nipples hardened and the moisture below began to flow.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He disengaged from kissing her lips, and using the arm that had held her head, pulled down her dress to expose one hardened nipple.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Before she could stop him or say a word, her head was thrown back in pleasure as his mouth and teeth latched onto her skin, pulling and tugging by turns.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As waves of pleasure passed over her, she became aware of a hard erection pressing up against her sex in surges, bared only by the think cloth of her dress.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Unable to bare anymore, she put her hand to his forhead pushing away, and atlast his mouth released her breast.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>But, as she though to gain relief, suddenly his hand was pulling up her dress, and then caressing her inner thigh, dangerously close to her lower lips.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then, with two of his fingers, he carefully spread her sex, while another finger rubbed up and down gently.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Her body responded with forward thrusts, and her breath continued ragged.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then, all at once her body spasmed, as he found that area of greatest pleasure, and worked it back and forth.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The waves of pleasure now were so intense, that she could barely stand it, but she could feel her body desiring more.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>With one hand, she reached out and firmly clasped his shaft and with her thumb rubbed the tip.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>His response was immediate, a low growl of pleasure escaped his lips.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>** With a sudden rush of desire, she pushed him back onto the cottage's wooden table.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pulling her woolen skirt up, she mounted him, and rubbed her lower lips along his shaft, as she delved into his mouth with deep kisses.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A few moments passed as they both ground their hips together, the skin below growing moist with their passion.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Her eye's closed as a wave of intense orgasm passed through her, and for a moment her body went rigid-spasiming slightly.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then, his hands were on her hips, and he rolled on top of her small frame.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then his, lips were at her nipples sucking and tugging, small gasps of plesure ripped from her lips.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She could feel the tip of his shaft, just pressing at her sex.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Needing, craving, desiring more, she grabbed his taught muscular shoulders, and pulled her body to his.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>His warm thick shaft, slid easily into her and the englishman's eyes rolled back, a hiss escaping his lips.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>His hand went to her leg, pulling it up and then the deep thrusting began.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>One, two, three surges of his body pounding her deep within.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>With each thrust his body tensed more, preparing for that ultimate release.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The anticipation of his release caused her to climax again, and her inner lips tense around his erection.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>His body remained tense for a moment, before lowering down onto her, his huge frame coming to settle over her.</p>

                        <p>A few moments passed, they lay together, and she realize for the first time in months.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The man on-top of her was James Farthing, her husband who had gone away to settle some affairs regarding the familiy shipping business.</p>
