                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once upon a time, there was fair Scottish lass, named Courtney.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She dressed in plain clothes and lived in a simple kingdom, in a humble cottage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Her beauity was known throughout the small town of Brockton and it's surrounding country-side.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There was scarecely a man who didn't wish to posess her, body and soul.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>One day she had taken to the highlands, enjoying a walk in the crisp morning air, when she spotted a man on the horizon.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She paused, for it was not always safe to wonder the highlands, not knowing the sort of men she would encounter.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then, at once, the man on the horizon began to run, and his course was clearly in her direction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A few more seconds passed while she sought to determine his features.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As he closed, his features grew clear and she could tell he was tall, powerfully built and with a calm way about him, though underlined by something slightly savage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He closed quickly and her several courses of action flitted through her mind.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She decided that a swift return to her cottage was best, and began sprinting down the lane.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Despite her speed, he gained on her but she had just enough time to reach the cottage and slam the door when, the persuer hit the door with a hard thud.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Out of breath, she leant against the door, waiting with slight apprehension.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A few seconds passed, before the door thudded strongly, and a deep hoarse voice sounded from the other side.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"Fair lass, let me in", the voice begged. "For I have traveled far, and you are fairest thing I've seen in all my life."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"But sir, I do not know you, and your persuit gave me quite the start". She responsed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To which he replied, "I mean you no harm, fair miss. I thought perhaps you were a mirage, or phantom which would disappear."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"It is for this reason, I sought you quickly", the man finished.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>After pondering for a few moments, the fair maiden replied. "I am sorry sir, but I cannot permit you enterace. For I know nothing of you, or your intentions."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A long sigh, was heard from the outside of the door, and then a heavy weight settled against the it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A long moment passed, before he responded. "I am british, come from far south of here, to seek the fairest maiden in the land, and possess her."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The words of the man speed the maidens heart and kindled an anticipation deep within.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"If you would possess me, then be patient sir, and court me as a proper gentleman would." The woman answered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Another long sigh sounded from outside the door before a reply came, that had with it good humor mixed with just a hint of frustration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>"I give you till midnight tonight."</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The weight pressed against the door lifted, and she could hear the mans foot steps moving off.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The beating of her heart slowed and after a few seconds she dared to peak through a small crack in the wooden door.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The man had moved away from the house, and lifting a heavy pack from his back, set it by the stone hedge, which skirted the house.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He then looked back to the house, with light blue eye's that seemed to peirce the door. Almost as though he knew she was watching.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>** After a few minutes, of resting himself, the man rose from the ground rummaged in his pack. After finding what he was looking for, he approached the house, and hung something just out of sight on the door outside bolt.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He then surveyed the small cottage and it's surroundings, before setting to work.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As with any highlands homestead, there were small choirs that needed to be accomplished. Wood chopped, troughs filled with water, and animals fed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>He proceeded about each task accomplishing one after the next, until evening fell and little light remained.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Then tired and weary from the days exhertions, he rested by the fire and fried a fish from the nearby creek.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The meal seemed to refresh him, and after a long stretch and gaze back to the cottage, where the maiden still kept watch, he wondered down to the creek. Just out of her view.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The maiden Courtney, deciding it was safe enough, opened the door and retrieved the object he had hung.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Now by candle light, she could just make out a silver chain and ornament, shaped like a Claddagh ring. Her hands moved over the familiar shape, and her heart quickened.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Hearing a loud splash outside, she peared through the openeing, but was unable to see the man, as the embankment dipped below her sight.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Climbing up to the small atic, she found a suitable crack, and peered out down to the river bank, which was illuminated by the fire, the englishman had lit.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>There in the soft glow of the fire and moon light, the man stood naked, waist deep in water. His hard muscled body glistening.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As he cupped and then poured water over his head, small rivuletts ran down his naked skin, curving around and almost tracing his full chest and hardened abs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>His hands passed over his skin, removing traces of dirt that remained before turning around, and striding out of the water.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>She could see his full naked body, only his manhood was obscured by both candle and firelight.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>As she watched, she could feel her own bodies desires begin to awaken and become sensitive. Then her heart jumed a beat, as she realized he was moving toward the cottage.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>To be continued...</p>

                <p>L9 includes a custom written set of spacing for h1-h5, paragraphs, list and other common html text based elements. These defaults overwrite the standard and non-uniform conventions that diverge with each browser.</p>

                    <h3>* All</h3>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The idea behind these defaults it two fold. (1) To move browser defaults and assure cross browser compatibility. (2) To allow elements to flow naturally within the page. If you aren't use to these convention, it make take some getting used to.</p>
