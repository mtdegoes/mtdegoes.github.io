#### My Sphero is trying to kill me, what should I do?
	
1. Start Running
2. Hope that Sphero is low on power
3. Keep Running
4. If possible, push someone into Sphero's path.
5. If Sphero gets close, begin to hoping up and down. Doing so will not save you, but may provide those around you with some amusement.
6. Die as Sphero burrows a hole in your chest.
