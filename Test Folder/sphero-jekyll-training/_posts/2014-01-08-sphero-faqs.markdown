#### How many Spheros are sentient?
The exact number is hard to determine, but seems to be based upon the number kicked.

#### What does being kicked have to do with it?
When kicked the Sphero sentients switch is sometimes jossled and turned to "Hal" mode. Don't be alarmed as Hal Mode is the most placid of the sentient settings.

#### Are there any modes I should be aware of?
The only mode to be truly concerned about is the "terminator" mode. While we have no proof, it's rumored that some users have dissapeared after this mode has been engaged.
