                <h1>Ship Reference</h1>
                <h2>Hull Points (HP)</h2>
                <p>Hull points prepresent the total amount of damage a given vessel can absorb. Ships with 1 hit point, are destroyed and remove from the board as soon as they lose this single point. Other vessels have more hull points and require all points to be remove before the ship is destroyed. Any ship placed on the board represents a single health point...aka fighters and bombers.</p>
                <h2>Movement Points (MP)</h2>
                <p>Movement points represent the number of sectors a given ship may proceed. 1 point per sector.</p>
                <h2>Attack Points (AP)</h2>
                <p>Represents the total number of die that may be rolled to achieve a "hit" on an opposing ship. Most dice rolls consist of a 50/50 chance that damage will occur. In the event that damage does occur, remove a hit point from the opposing vessel.</p>

                <h1>Sub-Systems</h1>
                <h2>Flak Cannons</h2>
                <p>Flak cannons represent the ability of capital ships to concentrate their fire power along a given jump trajectory. AKA, the dark blue lines between solar systems. Placing the "flak" icon along these lines, gives you an additional AP, per vessel passing through this flack field.</p>
                <h2>Mines</h2>
                <p>Mines are placed in sectors currently occupied by your vessel and remain there for the remainder of the engagement. Each fleet is granted 2 mines per engagement. These weapons are activated when an opposing ship enters the sector they occupy. Mines can only effect one vessel and are removed from the board once used. For fighers, a die is rolled with 50/50 chances of escaping damage. Capital ships entering, immediately lose 1 HP. Mines cannot be delayed and automatically activiate on the first ship entering the system. The mines tokens are used, which are represented by the ? token, but have a small *  on the bottom indicating a mine token.</p>
                <h2>Decoys</h2>
                <p>Mines are placed in sectors currently occupied by your vessel and remain there for the remainder of the engagement. Each fleet is granted 3 decoys per engagement. These sub-systems are "fake" mines and have no effect on enemy vessels or movement. The decoy tokens are used, which are represented by the ? token, but have no icon on the bottom.</p>
