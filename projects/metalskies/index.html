                <h1>Ships</h1>
                <h2>Destroyer</h2>
                <p>Capital ships have three primary forms of engagement. The primary form of engagement is launching a tactical nuke, which follows the standard guidelines for nuke movement. Each destroyer has a compliment of 4 nukes. The secondary form of engagement is directed toward fighter craft. And is in the form of Flak cannons which can be used in the form of flak fields and engaging fighters at close range. The final form of engagement is mine or decoy laying. Upto the fleet limit 3 mines.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 HP</li>
                    <li>2 MP</li>
                    <li>1 AP</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Fighter</h2>
                <p>Fighters primary form of engagement is attacking capital ships or fighters at close range. This means they must be within the same sector as their intended target.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 HP</li>
                    <li>3 MP</li>
                    <li>1 AP</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Bomber</h2>
                <p>Bombers have three forms of engagement. The primary form of engagement is launching a tactical nuke, which follows the standard guidelines for nuke movement. Each bomber has a compliment of 2 nukes. The secondary form of engagement for bombers is attacking capital ships or fighters at close range. This means they must be within the same sector as their intended target. The final form of engagement is in the form of the mine the bomber carries. Bombers can lay either mines and/or decoys.</p>

                <h1>Ship Reference</h1>
                <h2>Hull Points (HP)</h2>
                <p>Hull points prepresent the total amount of damage a given vessel can absorb. Ships with 1 hit point, are destroyed and remove from the board as soon as they lose this single point. Other vessels have more hull points and require all points to be remove before the ship is destroyed. Any ship placed on the board represents a single health point...aka fighters and bombers.</p>
                <h2>Movement Points (MP)</h2>
                <p>Movement points represent the number of sectors a given ship may proceed. 1 point per sector.</p>
                <h2>Attack Points (AP)</h2>
                <p>Represents the total number of die that may be rolled to achieve a "hit" on an opposing ship. Most dice rolls consist of a 50/50 chance that damage will occur. In the event that damage does occur, remove a hit point from the opposing vessel.</p>

                <h1>Sub-Systems</h1>
                <h2>Flak Cannons</h2>
                <p>Flak cannons represent the ability of capital ships to concentrate their fire power along a given jump trajectory. AKA, the dark blue lines between solar systems. Placing the "flak" icon along these lines, gives you an additional AP, per vessel passing through this flack field. Any ship passing through the Flak Icon must roll the die to determine hit or miss. Ratio is 50/50. Flak cannons can also be used to attack fighters within the same sector or capital ships within the same sector. When in the same sector fighter engagement ratio is 50/50 and capital ships engagement ratio is 33/66 in favor of damage.</p>
                <h2>Mines</h2>
                <p>Mines are placed in sectors currently occupied by your vessel and remain there for the remainder of the engagement. Each fleet is granted 2 mines per engagement. These weapons are activated when an opposing ship enters the sector they occupy. Mines can only effect one vessel and are removed from the board once used. For fighers, a die is rolled with 50/50 chances of escaping damage. Capital ships entering, immediately lose 1 HP. Mines cannot be delayed and automatically activiate on the first ship entering the system. The mines tokens are used, which are represented by the ? token, but have a small *  on the bottom indicating a mine token.</p>
                <h2>Decoys</h2>
                <p>Mines are placed in sectors currently occupied by your vessel and remain there for the remainder of the engagement. Each fleet is granted 3 decoys per engagement. These sub-systems are "fake" mines and have no effect on enemy vessels or movement. The decoy tokens are used, which are represented by the ? token, but have no icon on the bottom.</p>
                <h2>Nukes</h2>
                <p>Tactical Nukes can be fired from capital ships and bombers. These weapons are launched along standard jump lines and cointinue in a straight direction until the path ends, or a ship is encounted. In the case of fighters being encountered, the nuke owner can opt to detonate the nuke. The result of which, is the defending owner, rolling die for all fighters effected. 50/50 chance of the fighter being destroyed. In the case a nuke encounters a capital ship, that vessel immediately loses 4 HP. Nukes do not move the first turn fired. Also at the beginning of a players turn, all fired nukes of their fleet are moved prior to any other vessel. When a nuke passes through a flak barrier, the defending army has a 1/6th chance to destroy the nuke. Nukes move at a speed of 3 sectors per turn.</p>
                <h2>Fleet Cards</h2>
                <p>Fleet cards are given out at the beginning of the game and earned by destroying enemy vessels. Players may have no more than 5 fleet cards in their hand at any given time, and must discard (or play) down to this number. Fleet cards may be played at any time.</p>
                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <p>These are the cards which make up the playing board for Metal Skies. When beginning a game, players mix up the cards and then divide them evenly among all players. Players then roll the dice to determine who starts first, with the turn proceeding counter-clock wise from this starting location. On their turn, each player places one card down onto the playing surface. When placing a card the blue Jump lines must connect to an existing jump line. Otherwise the card cannot be placed. Players must draw from the top card on their given deck, and proceed down. If a player cannot or does not wish to play the card on the top of their deck, they may choose to skip their turn. This allows them to place the top card on the bottom of the deck and use the preceeding card on their next turn. Sectors are limited to 1 ship per fleet group per sector, thus any fleet group may only have one ship in a sector at a time.</p>
