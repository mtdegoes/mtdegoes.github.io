<h4>How many Spheros are sentient?</h4>

<p>The exact number is hard to determine, but seems to be based upon the number kicked.</p>

<h4>What does being kicked have to do with it?</h4>

<p>When kicked the Sphero sentients switch is sometimes jossled and turned to &quot;Hal&quot; mode. Don&#39;t be alarmed as Hal Mode is the most placid of the sentient settings.</p>

<h4>Are there any modes I should be aware of?</h4>

<p>The only mode to be truly concerned about is the &quot;terminator&quot; mode. While we have no proof, it&#39;s rumored that some users have dissapeared after this mode has been engaged.</p>
